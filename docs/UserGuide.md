## 3. About

This section introduces you to some technical terms, syntax and symbols that are used throughout the guide. You may want to familiarize yourself with them before moving on to the next section.

Else, if you are already familiar with the syntax, you can skip this section and head on to [Features](#4-features) below for details of each command!

### 3.1. Structure of this document

We have structured the User Guide in a way to help you find what you want and what you need easily. The [features](#4-features) are separated into 4 main categories namely:
* User Interface
* Modules
* Students
* Schedules

In the next [subsection](#32-reading-this-document), you can find several useful tips on how to read this guide.

### 3.2. Reading this document

This section introduces to you some terminologies, symbols and syntax that are used throughout the user guide. You may find it useful to familiarize yourself with them before moving on to the next section.

#### 3.2.1 Symbols

The table below shows the general symbols and syntax used throughout the user guide.

| Syntax                                                                      | Definition                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`                                                                   | A grey highlighted block specifies an executable command that can be entered into the command box.       |
| <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :bulb: </div>               | An bulb icon indicates that the following text is a tip.                                                 |
| <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: </div> | An information sign indicates that the following text provides additional information that you may need. |
| <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger"> :exclamation: </div>      | An exclamation mark indicates that the following text is important.                                      |

#### 3.2.2 Command Syntax
Notes about the command format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
